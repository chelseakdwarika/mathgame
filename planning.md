Two **Players** take turns to answer simple math problems (addition)

New **Questions** are generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1-20.

Player whose turn it is must answer correctly or lose a life.

**Player** starts with **3 lives** and lose a life if a question is wrong.

The game outputs new scores for both Players at the end of every turn.

Game continues until one player loses all their lives, then we see who won and what their score was.

## EXAMPLE PROMPT

**Player 1**: "What does 5 + 3 = ?"
> 9
**Player 1**: "Seriously? No!"
**P1**: 2/3 vs P2: 3/3

-----NEW TURN-----
...some time later

Player 1 wins with a score of 1/3

----GAME OVER-----
Good bye!
